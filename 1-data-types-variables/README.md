# Assignment - Java Data Types & Variables

Please work out these tasks and upload them to your assignments space. 

**Happy coding!**

1. Fill in `summation()` (class **Calculator**) method body, so that will count summation of numbers `first` and `second`.
2. Fill in `division()` (class **Calculator**) method body, so that will count division of numbers `first` and `second`.
3. Fill in `multiplication()` (class **Calculator**) method body, so that will count multiplication of numbers `first` and `second`.
4. Fill in `remainder()` (class **Calculator**) method body, so that will count a remainder of numbers `first` and `second`.
5. Fill in `parseMinutesToDaysAndYears()` (class **Calculator**) method body, so that it counts number of days and years from supplied input parameter.
6. Create an instance of class **Animal** in class **Start** and define `name` attribute of the animal through constructor. Add an attribute `sound` to the animal and together with `color` attribute assign their values outside the class without using constructor complying to the encapsulation rules of object-oriented programming.
7. Fill in `splitting()` (class **StringParser**) method body, so that it returns string with value _"Hello, I am a: robot"_ using variables `firstText` and `secondText`. 
8. Fill in `replacement()` (class **StringParser**) method body, so that it returns string with value _"Hello, I am a: human"_ without changing value of variables `firstText` or `secondText`.
9. Fill in `concatenation()` (class **StringParser**) in a way, so that it connects strings from `firstText` and `secondText` and prints the result to the console output using class **Start**.
10. Adjust the **Start** class in a way that when running the application through this class, return values of all classes' methods (**Animal**, **Calculator**, and **StringParser**) are printed into the console output. 
11. Adjust the **Start** class in a way that user can set **Animal's** `name`, `color`, and `sound` through console input.
